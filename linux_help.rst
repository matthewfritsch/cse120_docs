Setting up Linux on your machine
==================================

What is Linux?
--------------------------
- Linux, in our context, is a general blanket-statement referring to a group of similar operating systems like Windows or MacOS. 
- There is no single version of "Linux OS" to install, which is different from something like Windows (where you assume you're installing the latest version). 
    - What you are looking for is a distribution of Linux, such as: Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Manjaro, Fedora, Solus, and more. If you're unfamiliar with most of these, install Ubuntu.
    - Something confusing you might find is that there are also multiple Ubuntu versions. These are different user experiences, but all fundamentally do the same thing. You can try basically any of them. Or, try KDE/XFCE/Budgie as those are the most Windows-esque experiences. 
- If you have never seen/used Linux before, the learning curve is a little bit steep and there are lots of words used to refer to other things. For example, if you search to install "Linux OS", this does not exist.
- However I will do my best to help you get set up and solve problems (provided we aren't being academically dishonest). My Discord is macmoholic#2221 if you'd like to DM me for questions, but to be clear, I'm not gigabrain or anything I just have Linux experience

- On Windows
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
        - Please see this page for info on installing Linux as a subsystem on your Windows installation: (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
        - I can assist if need be, but I have Linux installed separately from Windows, so I may not be very useful. Google is your friend.
    - Virtual Machine (VM)
        - Please see this video for info on installing Linux in a virtual machine on your Windows installation: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc)
        - As above, I can try to assist if need be.

- On MacOS
    - Virtual Machine (VM)
        - Please see this video for info on installing Linux in a virtual machine on your MacOS installation: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ZNAKmm0dI)
        - I am full of hatred for MacOS, so if you want to ask me questions on solving problems for this, you have to tell me if you have a dog (or dogs) and also send a picture of that dog (or dogs)
