Setting up Linux on your machine
==================================

What is Linux?
--------------------------
- Linux, in our context, is a general blanket-statement referring to a group of similar operating systems like Windows or MacOS. 
- There is no single version of "Linux OS" to install, which is different from something like Windows (where you assume you're installing the latest version). 
    - What you are looking for is a distribution of Linux, such as: Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Manjaro, Fedora, Solus, and more. If you're unfamiliar with most of these, install Ubuntu.
    - Something confusing you might find is that there are also multiple Ubuntu versions. These are different user experiences, but all fundamentally do the same thing. You can try basically any of them. Or, try KDE/XFCE/Budgie as those are the most Windows-esque experiences. 
- If you have never seen/used Linux before, the learning curve is a little bit steep and there are lots of words used to refer to other things. For example, if you search to install "Linux OS", this does not exist.
- However I will do my best to help you get set up and solve problems (provided we aren't being academically dishonest). My Discord is macmoholic#2221 if you'd like to DM me for questions, but to be clear, I'm not gigabrain or anything I just have Linux experience
