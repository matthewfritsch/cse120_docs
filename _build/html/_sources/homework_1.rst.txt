How to connect remotely to the bohr1 server
---------------------------------------------

* Get your SSH client open
* Connect to the unix timeshare. On a terminal, this can be ``ssh (cruz ID)@unix.ucsc.edu``
* Once on the unix timeshare, ssh into the bohr1 server with ``ssh cse120_(group number)@bohr1.soe.ucsc.edu``
* You're now connected!
